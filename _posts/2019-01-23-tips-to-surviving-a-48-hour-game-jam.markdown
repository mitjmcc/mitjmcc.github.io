**Game Jams** are a fun way to get together with other people while strapping together the best game you can make in such a short amount of time.

Last year, I participated in the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/), made a [game](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/blind-justice), and [won a nomination](https://ggda.org/blog/best-in-georgia-competition-returns-for-2018/) for the Best in Georgia Competition.

This year, I wanted make myself a list of things I could have done better and thought I might as well share it!

#### 1. Have fun
This is the most important thing.
The rest of these tips are all about ensuring that you are!

#### 2. Bring a pillow and something to sleep on*
***\*If you are going to a hosted location.***
Sleeping on the floor is rough, though having a backpack for a pillow helps.
Sleep is important, especially when you're working under pressure.

#### 3. Scope your project
This all depends on how many people are working on the game and their skill set!
Have a good idea of what you are capable of.
Start small than work your way up if you have time.

#### 4. Don't stress over not finishing
Worrying about getting done can detract from the experience being fun.
There are always ways to take what you have and turning it into something presentable.
Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.

#### 5. Talk with people
Everyone else participating is going through the same thing as you are.
Bounce ideas off them, form teams, get critiques, connect!
