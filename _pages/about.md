Heyo I'm Mitch! Sometimes known as iamhand. I am a Technical Artist specialized in VFX, rendering and materials. I have been in the video games industry for 4 years.

I started as a Software Engineer doing gameplay programming and porting in Casino Games, while doing VFX and shader development on indie games.

I jumped into Technical Art after 3 years of doing it in my free time, joining a mobile games studio in 2021.

I really enjoy being a part of online real-time VFX and Technical Art communities and building up other people with tutorials, tips and memes.
